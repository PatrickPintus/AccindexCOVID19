Acceleration Index to Track Epidemics Dynamics
R codes to accompany two papers published in PLoS ONE:
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252443 in which Acceleration Index is shown to correct for time-varying tests and applied to French data
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281943 in which Acceleration Index is decomposed into Reproduction Number and its bias due to time-varying tests
