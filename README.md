R codes to accompany two papers published in PLoS ONE:

(1) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252443 in which Acceleration Index is shown to take into account time-varying tests and applied to French data

(2) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281943 in which Acceleration Index is decomposed into Reproduction Number and its bias due to time-varying tests
