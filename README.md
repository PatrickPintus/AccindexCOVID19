The Acceleration Index is a novel indicator that takes into account diagnostic tests to track accurately the dynamics of epidemics 

R codes to accompany two papers published in PLoS ONE (Open Access academic journal): 

(1) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252443 in which Acceleration Index is shown to take into account time-varying tests and is applied to French data

(2) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281943 in which how Reproduction Number and its bias due to time-varying tests combine into the Acceleration Index, using French and other countries' data as an illustration
